                <h3> About Wyplay </h3>
                <p> From <a href="http://www.wyplay.com/?page=at-a-glance">wyplay website</a> :
                    <div class="quote">
                        <blockquote>
                            Wyplay was founded in 2006 with the vision that the new emerging media over Internet and home connected devices would completely disrupt the TV ecosystem status quo and that most operators didn't have the right tools to address these new convergence trends and new challengers in a timely manner.
                            Based on this vision, the company developed an open, modular and innovative software solution to answer the operator's convergence challenges.
                            Wyplay has since insured the success of the most demanding Tier1 operators including SFR, Vodafone, Proximus, Canal+, Sky Italia & DishTV.
                        </blockquote>

                <h3> "Ether" Step 2 : A middleware for DCI804RMU, a SetTopBox from Technicolor for R-Mundo</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.mundo-r.com/gl">R Mundo</a> is a Spannish Digital TV cable operator in Galicia.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.technicolor.com/">Technicolor</a> was the project architect and integrator. They designed the hardware around an :
                    <li><A href="http://www.st.com">ST-micro</a> 7141, which is nearly the same SoC than the <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/digital-set-top-box-ics/legacy-products/legacy-processors/sti7105.html">sti 7105
                    </a>, used by Canal+ in some of thier their DDT&amp;SAT STBs... Plus an <i>ad-hoc</i> "cable TCP/IP" (DOCSIS) interface.</li>
                    <li><a href="http:/www.cinfo.es/">CInfo</a> was the User Interface/Application desgner and developper</li>
                    <li>And <a href="http://www.wyplay.com/fr/">Wyplay</a> was providing the middleware for this board.
                    As the SoC was very close to the sti7105 used in Canal+ DTT STBs, many generic development done for the former operator could be back-ported in this project.

                <p>
                The <b>S.D.C.</b> was a division of Alten Rennes, which was aimed to provide a comptetive service, compared to Alcatel's indian subsidiaries. The argument was :

                <p>
                Open Service Platform of Alcatel is a multi-blade server technology, powered by Solaris. Its role is to manage the classical commutated telephone network, to implement what is called the Intelligent Network. It allow valuable services far way beyond reaching the receipient of a voice call (which is the basic task of <a href="">PTSN</a> and does not imply I.N.).
                For instance, Flexible Routing and Charging (FRC) service allows a victim of a break down on the motorway, to call a special number (nationally unique) from its mobile and reach the nearest <b>&lt;b&gt;&lt;YourBrand&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</b> Automobile Technical Center, that is open, and having room for this customer.

It now allows fixe/mobile convergence (corporate people can seamlessly initiate a short-number call from their mobile phone, off-site : this is because the service can be triggered as soon as the user pick up the phone ! It also allows the corporate user to manage its own mobility, setup call routing (<i>e.g.</i> to office, mobile, home or voicemail) from a public web interface (obv. using authentication).

                        <li>
<b>France Télécom Ticket Téléphone : </b> The goal was to develop an intelligent service allowing pre-paid phone card, usable from any public phone, or even private phone. By calling a free number, the customer could charge a call on his account from any phone, and could recharge his account by buying vouchers, in various shop. The service was designed to be deplayed in North Africa (mainly Marrocco) by France Télécom.

This project was a chance for a ramp-up training of the whole SDC. It allowed Junior Developpers to make thier hands on the toolchain, and for seniors it was a chance to organise the service, but the developpement was finely driven by alcatel. It was also the first occasion to deliver a software to Alcatel's validation team.
