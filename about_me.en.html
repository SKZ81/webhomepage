        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>Here is the list of values (qualities) that I believe in. I'm convinced they are needed to reach success in our projects (and, at least, to setup a good and pleasant, then productive, working environment):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knowledge sharing,</li>
            <li>Sincerity / Transparency,</li>
            <li>Helpfulness,</li>
            <li>Positiveness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hobbies </h2>
        <h3>Freetime projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quadcopter building</b>: starting from a hardware kit (frame, motors, propellers, and so on) and after assembling it (which required to fix various problem due to neglectful chineese providers) the project is to realise an autonomus fly controller, based on an <b>AVR</b> microcontroller, as a first step. It is "minimalistic", a kind of <i>proof-of-concept</i> that one can do basic autonomous flight, in 8-bit, with very few RAM space.</li>
            <li><b>openPowerSwitch</b>: the goal is to reproduce the features of an existing product I was using in Wyplay. a "power switch" is a multi-socket mains extension, which allows to control remotely and individually each outlet it holds through the network, using HTTP requests. The <b>AVR</b> microcontroller is wired to relays (one per outlet) to switch 220V AC, and to an ethernet/RJ45 interface for the network part. On the software side, I use <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3413/7ccad5ff56c720edd144da542c392279df96.pdf">uip</a> (micro-IP), a tiny but full-featured IP stack written by <a href="http://dunkels.com/adam/software.html">Adam Dunkels</a>. This project is also a chance (not done yet) to get into CAD software: <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org">freeCAD</a> to design the casing (absolutely needed because of the 220VAC) and <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org">kicad</a>, to maybe produce my own PCB design.</li>
            <li><b>Automatic watering system:</b> feeding water to potted vegetable and/or flowers. It implies sensors to detect the water needing, a pump, a tank, and so on. Nowadays I only played around with mouisture sensor, and found out they are not that accurate. I'm considering measuring total weight also (or instead), to deduced amout of evaporated water.</li>
            <li><b>media "TV" box</b>: integrating <a href="https://kodi.tv">kodi</a> on a raspberry pi, to be able to play various media, especially from the internet, from streaming sites (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>), or IP TV channels (like <a href="https://www.arte.tv/fr/guide/">ARTE+7</a>)... I started this project because internet subscription is much more expensive in Belgium than in France. Indeed, I subscribed to a "naked" connection, without TV channels offer ; but I wanted to be able to browse contents, launch a medias or change the settings (like sound volume)... With a nice "10-feet interface", and without having to grab mouse and keyboard thanks to a dedicated Remote Control Unit.</li>
            <li><b>Writing articles</b>: on my <a href="https://skz81.wordpress.com/">technical blog</a>, about various tests, tries, and small tinkering I do.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gardening</b>: mainly, i like to to grow my own home-made and organic vegetables,</li>
            <li><b>D-Jing</b>: digitally, <i>i.e.</i> using a computer wired to a MIDI / USB controller, and <a href="https://www.mixxx.org">mixxx</a> as the software (Free &amp; Open-Source).</li>
            <li><b>Scientific inquisitiveness</b>: reading (or watching videos) about various topics:  Quatum physics and relativity, biology (mainly cellular biochemistry and brain mecanisms), archeology, or even epistemology and philosophy of science... This is a non-exhaustive list !</li>
            <i>And the obvious, classical:</i>
            <li><b>Hanging around with friends</b>, drinking some beers :)...</li>
        </ul>
