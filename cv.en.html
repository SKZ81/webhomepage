                        <blockquote>
                            Wyplay was founded in 2006 with the vision that the new emerging media over Internet and home connected devices would completely disrupt the TV ecosystem <i>status quo</i> and that most operators didn't have the right tools to address these new convergence trends and new challengers in a timely manner.
                            Based on this vision, the company developed an open, modular and innovative software solution to answer the operator's convergence challenges.
                            Wyplay has since insured the success of the most demanding Tier1 operators including SFR, Vodafone, Proximus, Canal+, Sky Italia &amp; DishTV.

                                <h3 class="project-details-title"> Refactoring the middleware's <b>Mediarender</b> to control multiple <b>Player</b> instances </h3>

                                <b>Mediarenderer</b> is the middleware's entry point for playing media (<b>UI</b> or other clients do <b><u>NOT</u></b> directly send messages to the <b>player</b>/<b>recorders</b> component). It is also a kind of abstraction (implementing an API inspired by and very close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">UPnP</a> standards, regarding Audio/Video). The two main goals of this decoupled architecture are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Provide a comprenhensive but <u>simple</u> API to the client (typically <b>UI</b>), hiding the details in the depth, and, </li>
                                    <li> Allow the <b>player</b> component implementation to focus on the rendering of the media itself, whereever it comes from, allowing a simple and design of this critical component, which helps to ensure a good quality and reliability.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Context </h3>

                                Historically, to simplify the Mediarender's implementation, the assuption was made that only <b><u>ONE media</u></b> would be played at a given time (whatever its source, live channel or a video on USB drive), and then, only <b><u>ONE <b>player</b> instance</u></b> was needed. But, with the increasing power of processors, controlling multiple <b>player</b>'s instances became realistic, enabling features like:
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <u>Mozaic</u> (wanted by <b>Sky Italia</b>): by displaying multiple channels on screen at the same time (before, operators had to generate mozaic stream on the backend and stream it on a dedicated channel),</li>
                                    <li> <u>Fast Zapping</u> (wanted by <b>Canal+</b>): a number of channels (typically: previous and next but it's not limitative and a client/<b>U.I.</b> choice) are <b>preloaded</b>, meaning all the rendering chain is running for each of those channel, but they're not displayed on screen. When zapping (typically using "Progam +/-" keys) on a preloaded channel, mediarenderer just switch the displayed channel, drastically optimizing the latency.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Workload </h3>

                                This implied modifications at multiple levels:
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Interprocess Communication API (on <b>DBus</b>) </li>
                                    <li> on the <b>player</b> itself </li>
                                    <li> on the <b>recorders</b> mecanism (<b>recorders</b> are always instanciated when playing a live media, to allow timeshift, even if the user does NOT want to stores a "record" of the media) </li>
                                    <li> and finally, on <b>mediarender</b>, to issue those <b>DBus</b> API calls on players and <b>recorders</b>, and manage their lifetime cycles. </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Achievements </h3>

                                Mananing the <b>player</b> instances was pretty straigthforward ; the main complexity was about the recorders, how they bind (and detach) to <b>player</b> instances. Then my task were:
                                <ul>

                                    <p>The goal was to develop an <b>Intelligent Network</b> service managing pre-paid phone cards, usable from any phone, public or even private ones, by calling a free number to connect to the service.<br/>
                                    The end-customer/user could then make his call, charged on his own account, rather than on the line physically used.<br/>
                                    Accounts were recharges by buying vouchers, available in various shops. The service was designed to be deployed in North Africa (mainly Marrocco) by <b>France Télécom</b>.</p>
                                    <p>A technical constraint was to interface the service with the already existing and deployed voucher/accounts management backend server.</p>
                                    <p>This project was a chance for a ramp-up training of the early <b>S.D.C.</b> It allowed junior developpers to make their hands on the toolchain, while seniors and managers were finalizing organisation.<br/>
                                    It was also the first occasion for the <b>S.D.C.</b> to deliver a software to Alcatel's validation team.</p>
